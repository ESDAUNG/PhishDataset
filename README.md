# PhishDataset

Phishing Dataset : We collected phishing URLs from PhishTank , the most popular site distributing phishing websites, from May 2021 to June 2021. 

Legitimate Dataset : Legitimate URLs were prepared by the following steps: 
1) legitimate domains were chosen randomly from a set of domains included in the IP2Location  dataset consistently from January 2021 to March 2021, 
2) Each chosen domain was accessed by Apache Nutch crawler to gather the web pages located in the same domain at most 100 pages, and
3) A legitimate URL was randomly chosen from the gathered URLs in each domain.
